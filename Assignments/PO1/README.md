## P01 - Fraction Class
### Jack Leary
### Description:

This program performs arithmetic operations on fractions, allowing users to input numerators and denominators for two fractions to carry out addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The results are displayed in simplified form. Additionally, it compares fractions for equality and provides clear output for each operation, ensuring that users understand the results of their calculations.

### Instructions
To set up the project on Visual Studio,
- Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++).
- Ensure you have WSL working on your computer.
- Set your computer to be able to run Linux
- Once you run the program, follow the prompts to enter numerators and denominators for the fractions involved in each arithmetic operation.
- Each operation can be performed with different fractions as needed.


### Example Output:

Enter the numerator and denominator (e.g., 1 2 for 1/2): 1 3

Enter the numerator and denominator (e.g., 1 2 for 1/2): 6 11

1/3 + 4/5 = 17/15
