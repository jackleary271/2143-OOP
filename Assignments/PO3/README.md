## PO3 - Knucklebones on SFML
### Jack Leary
### Description:
This is the progress I made on a Knucklebones game made using SFML.

I was unable to fully complete the project, but I was able to create a dice roller that would read user mouse input on two grids. If the user clicked inside the grid, the dice would begin rolling and the side it landed on would permanently be etched into its box.

I was working on the ability for the program to store dice values as score for the game, but was unable to ever get that to work. Thus, this is all I have.
